# Project informations

WAIUA_RE stands for WAIUA Reloaded as it is a new version of a previously existing software

This project is an inspiration from [WAIUA (Who Am I Up Against?)](https://github.com/Soneliem/WAIUA) from [Soneliem](https://github.com/Soneliem) which has been canceled


As did Soneliem when creating his own version of WAIUA, I'm using this exact project to learn things as software engineer career begins.
